Final Project

1. Download dataset from kaggle - Human Protein Atlas - Single Cell Classification
2. Build two supervised models and predict labels for test data.
3. Similarly build one deep learning model and predict the labels.

For supervised models I used Decision tree and KNN.
For deep learning models used Resnet34.
